## ✅ **Completed Fixes**

### **Problem Identified**
User reported: "there is issues with navigation in every page. can't use back button it go to forms. and most of the forms are not showing correctly"

**Root Causes:**
1. ❌ Form components had no back navigation buttons
2. ❌ Users couldn't easily return to table views after creating/viewing forms
3. ❌ Poor user experience - had to use browser back button or navigate through sidebar menu

## **Solution Implemented**

Added consistent back button navigation to all 7 form components:

### **Pattern Applied to Each Form:**

```javascript
// 1. Import ArrowLeftOutlined icon
import { ArrowLeftOutlined } from '@ant-design/icons';

// 2. Add handleGoBack function
const handleGoBack = () => {
  navigate('/TargetTableRoute');
};

// 3. Add back button UI before form title
<div style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
  <Button 
    type="text" 
    icon={<ArrowLeftOutlined />} 
    onClick={handleGoBack} 
    style={{ color: 'white', fontWeight: 'bold', fontSize: '16px' }}
  >
    Back
  </Button>
</div>
```
