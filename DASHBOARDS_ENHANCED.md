### **API Endpoints Used**

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Used In |

## **Responsive Design**

### **Grid Breakpoints**
All dashboards use responsive column spans:
- `xs={24}` - Full width on extra small screens (mobile)
- `sm={12}` - Half width on small screens (tablet)
- `lg={8}` or `lg={6}` - Multiple columns on large screens (desktop)

### **Card Spacing**
- Gutter: `[16, 16]` (horizontal, vertical)
- Margin between sections: `24px`
- Card padding: `24px`

---

## **Color Scheme**

### **Gradient Backgrounds**

1. **Purple:** `linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)`
2. **Pink:** `linear-gradient(135deg, #f093fb 0%, #f5576c 100%)`
3. **Blue:** `linear-gradient(135deg, #4facfe 0%, #00f2fe 100%)`

7. **Peach (Motivation):** `linear-gradient(135deg, #ffecd2 0%, #fcb69f 100%)`

---

## **Loading States**

All statistic cards include loading skeletons:
```javascript
<Card loading={loading} bordered={false}>
  {/* Card content */}
</Card>
```

Loading is set to `true` initially and `false` after data fetch completes.

---

## **Error Handling**

All data fetching functions include try-catch blocks:
```javascript
try {
  const response = await axios.get('endpoint');
  // Process data
  setLoading(false);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error:', error);
  setLoading(false);
}
```
